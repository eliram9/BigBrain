        text: "I cannot say enough about Arianne and the incredible impact she has had on my life. She has an extraordinary ability to quickly identify patterns in my behavior and, more importantly, explain why I do the things I do. Her expertise in EMDR therapy has been a game-changer for me—I’ve made more progress in a short amount of time than I ever thought possible.My life is incredibly complex right now, with many moving parts, and Arianne has been invaluable in helping me navigate it all. She wears so many hats in our sessions, from a skilled social worker who understands the complexities of managing caregivers for the elderly, to someone who helps me figure out different financial aspects of my situation. Her support has been multifaceted, and I honestly don’t know what I would do without her.Before working with Arianne, I wasn’t thriving—I was merely surviving. But for the first time in my life, I truly believe that thriving is possible. At 55 years old, after working with many therapists, Arianne has helped me tap into a deep source of hope that I didn’t know existed. She has been nothing short of amazing, and I am so grateful to have her by my side on this journey.” Please let me know if I can help any further with this",
